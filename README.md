# German Bitcoin whitepaper

This is a German translation and LaTeX implementation of the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. While the original was not actually typesetted with LaTeX, Satoshi aimed to create a strong resemblance to its classic default look, hence this attempt to recreate it in German.
